# Dragon-Fractal

A Dragon curve is a recursive non-intersecting curve also known as the Harterâ€“Heighway dragon or the Jurassic Park dragon curve. It is a mathematical curve which can be approximated by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems. Lindenmayer systems: A Lindenmayer system, also known as an L-system, is a string rewriting system that can be used to generate fractals. Two principal areas include generation of fractals and realistic modeling of plants. Lindenmayer system begins with a string of symbols called the axiom and applies to the axiom a set of production rules which are used to rewrite the axiom. Recursive L-System are more interesting as it replaces a symbol with a copy of itself plus something extra.L-system follow some rules:

<h4>An L-system is a formal grammar consisting of 4 parts:</h4>
1. A set of variables: symbols that can be replaced by production rules.
2. A set of constants: symbols that do not get replaced.e.g: !, [, ], +, -.
3. A single axiom: a string & is the initial state of the system.
4. A set of production rules: defining the way/rule variables can be replaced.
